          During my national service, I successfully lead a team of two in the rebuilding of Apotica website.
          I leveraged on CSS3 flexbox, CSS3 grids and HTML5 apis to build a stunning industry level website 
          for Apotica Company Limited. I made the website highly responsive to Computers,
          tablets and mobile devices.
